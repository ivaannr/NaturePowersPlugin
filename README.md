# 🌿 NaturePowers

**NaturePowers** is a lightweight Minecraft plugin for Bukkit-based servers (Paper, Purpur, Spigot) that grants elemental powers to players based on their class. When a player shoots a bow, the plugin replaces the arrow with custom projectiles like fireballs, tridents, lightning arrows, and more.
